### Hello!

I'm a Senior Data Scientist with engineering background and expertise in developing production-grade statistical and machine learning models. Formerly a postdoctoral researcher using Deep Learning to predict the movement of marine structures and reduce the time spent on numerical simulations. Currently building Deep Learning models to predict sleep disorders from physiological data recorded by an innovative medical device.

Have experience in:
- Python (Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodels, Plotly)
- Natural Language Processing (NLTK, Gensim, spaCy)
- Databases (SQL, MongoDB)
- Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras)

As a Graduate Researcher I was able to take part and manage several projects that involved numerical simulations of structures, statistical analysis of time series, scientific software development as well as algorithms for optimizing mooring systems of offshore marine structures.
